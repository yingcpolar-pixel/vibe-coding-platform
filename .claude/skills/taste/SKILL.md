description: Reverse-engineer the design taste of any website. Given a URL, captures DOM data and a screenshot via real browser, then runs a 4-step analysis to produce taste.md + taste.json with practical design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows, grid) AND taste DNA (Trigger → Decision → Reason → Evidence trade-offs explaining WHY the design works). Use whenever the user wants to extract a site's design system, study a competitor's visual language, port an aesthetic to a new project, or generate design guidance for an AI coding agent. Triggers on: '/taste <url>', 'analyze the design of X', 'what makes X's site good', 'extract design tokens from X', 'give me X's design DNA', 'build something in the style of X', 'I want my app to feel like X'. Output rejects AI slop ('clean', 'modern', 'user-friendly') in favor of concrete px/hex values and restraint trade-offs. Do NOT use for: scraping data, summarizing page content, or tasks unrelated to visual design.
compatibility: Requires Playwright MCP. Claude Code: `claude mcp add playwright -s user -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest --isolated`. Gemini CLI: add to ~/.gemini/settings.json mcpServers block (see README).

# Taste — Reverse-Engineer a Website's Design DNA

This skill turns a URL into two files:

- **`./taste.md`** — human-readable. Two sections:
  - **Design Map** — practical tokens (colors, type scale, spacing, radii, shadows, grid)
  - **Taste DNA** — 3-4 opinionated trade-offs (Trigger → Decision → Reason → Evidence)
- **`./taste.json`** — structured. Same data, machine-parseable, for downstream tools (Cursor, Windsurf, design systems).

The pipeline rejects generic descriptions like "clean and modern". A finished `taste.md` should read like a senior designer explaining *why* this particular page made *these particular* choices — and what plausible alternatives it rejected.

## When to activate

Trigger this skill whenever the user wants to study a website's design and capture it as guidance for future design work. Catch all of these:

- Explicit slash form: `/taste <url>`
- Natural-language requests: "analyze the design of vercel.com", "what makes Stripe's site so good", "extract the design tokens from linear.app", "give me the design DNA for are.na"
- Mimicry intent: "I want my dashboard to feel like Linear", "build me a landing page in the style of <url>", "port this site's design to my project"
- Competitive research: "compare our look to <competitor>", "what design conventions does <site> use"
- Anywhere the user mentions a URL and asks about its design choices, typography, colors, spacing, philosophy, or "feel"

If the user mentions a URL in connection with any visual/design topic, lean toward activating — Claude tends to under-trigger skills. When in doubt, use it. The cost of a wasted skill invocation is small; the cost of generating generic design advice when this skill could have produced a specific, evidence-backed analysis is large.

Do NOT activate for: "extract data from a website" (use a scraping skill), "summarize the content of <url>" (use WebFetch), "deploy this site" (unrelated).

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the **Playwright MCP server** (https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-mcp) to be installed and connected. Verify with:

```bash
claude mcp list | grep playwright
```

If you see `playwright: ... - ✓ Connected`, you're good. If not, install it:

```bash
claude mcp add playwright -s user -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest --isolated
```

Why `--isolated`: every `/taste` run starts with a fresh browser state, so cookies, login sessions, and prior cache do not leak into the analyzed page. Without it, running `/taste https://linear.app` while you happen to be signed into Linear would analyze the app dashboard instead of the public marketing page — wrong surface, wrong taste.

Why `npx @playwright/mcp@latest` (with no `--browser` flag): Playwright will download and use its own bundled Chromium (~100MB, one-time). This is more portable than relying on the user's system Chrome — it works on machines without Chrome installed, gives consistent rendering across users, and never opens a window in the user's real browser profile.

After installing, the user must restart Claude Code for the MCP tools (`mcp__playwright__browser_*`) to appear in this session. If Playwright is unavailable when this skill runs, stop and tell the user clearly: "I need Playwright MCP to scrape the page. Run `claude mcp add playwright -s user -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest --isolated` and restart Claude Code, then try again."

On first run, Playwright may take ~30-60 seconds before its first `browser_navigate` returns — that is the one-time Chromium download. Subsequent runs start in seconds. If the user wants to pre-download to avoid the wait, they can run `npx playwright install chromium` once before invoking this skill.

## Workflow

Follow these five phases in order. Each phase has explicit success criteria — do not advance until the current phase has produced what the next phase needs.

### Phase 0 — Parse the URL and export target

**Step 1 — URL**

Extract the URL from the user's message. Accept these forms:
- `/taste https://linear.app`
- "analyze the design of vercel.com" (add `https://` if missing)
- A bare URL anywhere in the prompt

If the user provided no URL, ask for one. If they provided a file path or something that clearly isn't a URL, ask whether they meant a hosted page. Don't proceed until you have a real URL.

Resolve common short forms before navigating: `linear.app` → `https://linear.app`, `https://www.stripe.com` is fine as-is.

**Step 2 — Extract domain for file naming**

From the URL, extract the hostname and strip any `www.` prefix. Examples:
- `https://linear.app` → `linear.app`
- `https://www.stripe.com` → `stripe.com`
- `https://vercel.com/home` → `vercel.com`

Store this as `{domain}`. All output files will be named after it: `{domain}.md`, `{domain}.json`, and any export file. Never use the generic name `taste.md` — that name collides when the user runs this skill on multiple sites in the same directory.

**Step 3 — Export target**

If the user did not specify an export target in their message, ask once before starting the analysis:

> "Which tool are you building with? I'll format the output to match what it reads automatically.
>
> ```
>  1  Cursor          → .cursor/rules/{domain}-taste.mdc
>  2  Windsurf        → .windsurf/rules/{domain}-taste.md
>  3  Claude Code     → CLAUDE.md (appends Design Taste section)
>  4  GitHub Copilot  → .github/copilot-instructions.md (appends)
>  5  Bolt            → .bolt/prompt
>  6  Antigravity     → GEMINI.md
>  7  v0 by Vercel    → taste-tokens.css + instructions
>  8  Figma Make      → taste-figma.css + instructions
>  9  Lovable         → print text to paste in Project Knowledge
> 10  Skip            → keep {domain}.md + {domain}.json only
> ```"

Store the answer as `{exportTarget}`. If the user says "skip" or doesn't answer, set `{exportTarget}` to "skip". Do not ask again in Phase 5.

**Step 4 — Crawl scope**

Ask once, immediately after Step 3:

> "Should I analyze just this page, or explore 2–3 linked pages from the same site for a fuller picture?
>
> ```
>  1  This page only     → faster, focused on exactly what you gave me
>  2  Explore linked pages  → I'll find and visit 2–3 nav pages and merge the data
>                             (better for sites with distinct sections: Product, Community, Pricing…)
> ```"

Store as `{crawlScope}`: `"single"` or `"multi"`. Default to `"single"` if the user skips or answers ambiguously. Do not ask again.

### Phase 1 — Capture page data (Playwright MCP)

Run these steps in order. If any step errors, stop the pipeline and report the error to the user — do not silently continue with degraded data.

1. **Resize the viewport** to 1440×900 so measurements are consistent across runs:

   ```
   mcp__playwright__browser_resize  width=1440  height=900
   ```

2. **Navigate** to the URL:

   ```
   mcp__playwright__browser_navigate  url=<the URL>
   ```

3. **Wait briefly** for client-side hydration. Heavy SPAs (figma.com, notion.so) need a few seconds after `domcontentloaded` to render real content. Use:

   ```
   mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for  time=3
   ```

   If after 3 seconds the page snapshot still looks like a loading skeleton, give it another 3 seconds. If it's still skeleton after that, note it in the final output ("page may be incompletely rendered; some measurements approximate").

4. **Take two screenshots** — viewport first, then full-page:

   **4a. Viewport screenshot** (1440×900, un-scaled — this is your primary visual reference for Step 1):
   ```
   mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot  type=jpeg  filename=taste-viewport.jpeg
   ```

   **4b. Full-page screenshot** (for systematic color/layout checking across the whole page):
   ```
   mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot  fullPage=true  type=jpeg  filename=taste-fullpage.jpeg
   ```

   Use the **viewport screenshot** as the primary visual reference in Step 1 — it represents the first impression the designer intended. Use the full-page screenshot to verify patterns that only appear lower on the page (footer typography, late-section color variations, etc.). JPEG keeps token cost down vs. PNG.

5. **Run the DOM extractor**. Read `references/extract.js` and pass its **entire contents** as the `function` argument:

   ```
   mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate  function=<contents of references/extract.js>
   ```

   The tool returns a JSON object. Save it mentally as `domData` — you'll feed it into Step 1.

6. (Optional cleanup) The browser stays open for the rest of the session. No need to close it unless the user asks.

**Multi-page capture** (only if `{crawlScope}` is `"multi"`):

After capturing the primary page, extract navigation links and visit up to 2 additional pages from the same site.

**6a. Extract nav links** from the already-loaded primary page:

```js
(function() {
  const links = [];
  const seen = new Set([location.pathname]);
  const skip = /\/(login|logout|signup|sign-in|register|auth|account|checkout|cart|password|reset)\b/i;
  document.querySelectorAll('nav a, header a, [role="navigation"] a').forEach(a => {
    try {
      const u = new URL(a.href);
      if (u.hostname !== location.hostname) return;
      if (skip.test(u.pathname)) return;
      if (seen.has(u.pathname)) return;
      if (u.pathname === '/' && location.pathname !== '/') return;
      seen.add(u.pathname);
      links.push({ href: u.origin + u.pathname, text: (a.innerText || a.textContent).trim().slice(0, 40) });
    } catch(e) {}
  });
  return links.slice(0, 6);
})()
```

**6b. Pick 2 pages** from the returned list. Prefer:
- Shorter paths (`/product` over `/product/features/detail`)
- Distinct section names (Product, Community, Pricing, Docs — not just different slugs under the same section)
- Avoid the root `/` if you already captured it

**6c. For each additional page**, repeat the Phase 1 capture loop (navigate → wait 3s → viewport screenshot → full-page screenshot → DOM extractor). Name screenshots `taste-viewport-2.jpeg`, `taste-viewport-3.jpeg`, etc. Store each page's data as `pages[1]`, `pages[2]` (with `pages[0]` being the primary URL).

If a linked page fails to load or is blocked, skip it silently and note it in the Phase 6 report.

**6d. Merge data** before Phase 2. Combine color candidates across all pages (union), typography across all pages (union). When a value appears on 2+ pages it is a **system signal** — mark it. Values that appear on only one page are **local** — still capture them, but weight them lower.

In Steps 1–3, always state how many pages were analyzed ("Across 3 pages: …") and distinguish system patterns from local ones. Multiple-page agreement is the strongest available evidence for a taste principle.

**Success criterion for Phase 1**: you have at least one screenshot AND a populated `domData` JSON (from the primary page) with `colors`, `typography`, `layout`, `effects`, `cards`, `images`, `spacingSamples`, `sectionGaps`, and `grid` fields. If any of these are completely empty *and* the screenshot shows real content, the extractor needs improvement — note it and proceed anyway.

### Phase 2 — Run the 4-step analysis

> **Screenshot is ground truth.** Before reading any reference file: the viewport screenshot shows what a human actually sees. The DOM data supplies exact numbers. When they conflict, trust the screenshot. A color that appears in DOM but covers <5% of visible surface area is decorative — do not list it as a brand color. Section dividers that don't appear in the screenshot don't exist, regardless of what the DOM reports. Imperceptible shadows (≤3% opacity) are CSS artifacts, not design decisions.

The four reference files in `references/` contain the full prompts for each step. Read each one when you reach it (don't preload all four at once — the steps are deliberately sequential and earlier steps don't need later instructions).

For each step:
1. Read the corresponding reference file.
2. Generate the output it asks for, in your own response.
3. Start the output with the marker line specified in the reference (e.g., `### Step 1 Output — Measurements`).
4. The next step gets your prior outputs as input — keep them in the conversation, don't summarize them away.

#### Step 1 — Measure
- Read `references/step1-measure.md`
- Inputs: `domData` (the JSON from `browser_evaluate`) + the screenshot
- Produce: 20 categories of measurements, every value cited with a specific px / hex / ratio

#### Step 2 — Pattern
- Read `references/step2-pattern.md`
- Inputs: Step 1 output
- Produce: 5-8 systematic patterns, each with Pattern / Evidence / Design Goal

#### Step 3 — Taste
- Read `references/step3-taste.md`
- Inputs: Step 1 + Step 2 outputs
- Produce: 4 taste principles (each Trigger / Decision / Reason / Evidence), at least one Restraint trade-off

#### Step 4 — Observer
- Read `references/step4-observer.md`
- Inputs: Step 1 + 2 + 3 outputs + the original URL (you have to substitute it into the JSON's `source` field)
- Produce: a fenced ```json``` block followed by the Markdown Design Map + Taste DNA

### Phase 3 — Write the output files

Step 4's response contains both formats. Extract them:

1. **JSON**: find the first ```json``` fenced code block in Step 4's output. Parse it (it must be valid JSON — if it isn't, that's a Step 4 failure; re-run Step 4 with the parse error pointed out).
2. **Markdown**: take everything in Step 4's output *after* the JSON block ends. Strip leading whitespace.

Then write two files into the **current working directory** (use `pwd` if you need to confirm where that is), using the `{domain}` you extracted in Phase 0:

- `./{domain}.md` — the Markdown portion
- `./{domain}.json` — the JSON, pretty-printed with 2-space indent

If either file already exists, overwrite without asking. Users invoking this skill twice on the same site expect the latest analysis to win.

### Phase 4 — Self-audit (Anti-Slop pass)

Run this grep via the Bash tool — do not scan mentally:

```bash
grep -icE 'clean|modern|sleek|visually appealing|user-friendly|intuitive|seamless|\belegant\b|minimalist|polished|refined' ./{domain}.md
```

If the count is **0**, the file passes. If **>0**, show the offending lines:

```bash
grep -inE 'clean|modern|sleek|visually appealing|user-friendly|intuitive|seamless|\belegant\b|minimalist|polished|refined' ./{domain}.md
```

For each hit:
- Inside a quoted foil ("they could have gone for a 'clean and modern' look, but instead…") — fine, counts as passing.
- Used as a positive descriptor of *this* design — slop. Edit the principle, re-save, re-run grep until count is 0.

Also verify with Bash:

```bash
grep -c "Design Map\|Taste DNA" ./{domain}.md
```

Must return **2**. If less, a section is missing — re-run Step 4 with the missing section called out.

Validate the JSON:

```bash
python3 -m json.tool ./{domain}.json > /dev/null && echo "valid" || echo "INVALID"
```

If any check fails, fix and re-run before shipping.

### Phase 5 — Export for your build tool

You already captured `{exportTarget}` in Phase 0. Do not ask again.

If `{exportTarget}` is "skip", go straight to Phase 6.

If `{exportTarget}` is "all", generate every file-based format (options 1–8).

Otherwise, use `{exportTarget}` to determine the export. Accept natural-language equivalents: "cursor", "windsurf", "claude" / "claude code", "copilot", "bolt", "antigravity" / "gemini", "v0", "figma" / "figma make", "lovable".

Read `references/export-formats.md` for the exact file paths, frontmatter structure, and content spec for each target. All formats draw from `taste.json` and must follow the same Anti-Slop rules — no vague vibes, cite specific px/hex.

### Phase 6 — Report

Print to the user (substitute actual `{domain}`, line count, and byte count):

```
✓ Wrote ./{domain}.md (<line-count> lines) and ./{domain}.json (<byte-count> bytes)
[if export file(s) written]: ✓ Also wrote <path(s)>

  Sharpest principle: "<name of the strongest taste principle>"
  → <one-sentence quote of its Decision>

  Open {domain}.md to read the full Design Map + Taste DNA.
```

Keep it tight. The files do the talking.

## Error handling

| Failure | Response |
|---|---|
| Playwright MCP not installed/connected | Stop with the exact install command from the Prerequisites section above. Do not try to fall back to WebFetch — the screenshot is essential for Step 1. |
| URL is unreachable / 404 / DNS fail | Tell the user the page didn't load. Don't ship an analysis based on an error page. |
| Cloudflare / bot-detection block | The screenshot will show a "verify you are human" page. Detect this in Step 1 (huge whitespace, single button labeled "Verify"). Tell the user the site blocks automated access; suggest they manually open the URL in their own browser if they want a screenshot, or try a different page on the same domain. |
| SPA still rendering after the wait | After two 3-second waits, proceed with what's there. Add a one-line caveat to the report: "Page may have been mid-hydration; some measurements approximate." |
| User gave a file path, not a URL | Ask whether they meant a hosted version. Don't try to open local files — this skill is for live pages. |
| User gave a URL behind a login | Detect the login page (form with password input). Tell the user this skill doesn't handle authenticated pages, suggest using the public marketing page instead. |
| Step 4 returns malformed JSON | Re-run Step 4 once with the specific parse error pointed out. If it fails again, save the raw output as `./taste-raw.md` and tell the user to inspect manually. |

## Notes on philosophy (read once, internalize, then mostly forget)

This skill is built on a strong opinion: design tokens alone are useless for an AI agent. Tokens say "spacing is 8px"; taste says "spacing is 8px *because* the designer chose readable rhythm over data density, and 8px is the smallest unit that still feels intentional at 1× zoom". The Reason is what makes the same agent generate good design for a *different* page, instead of just copying numbers.

The four prompts in `references/` are a port of a Gemini-based pipeline that was validated in production. The single biggest failure mode in early versions was generic output — paragraphs of "this design uses a clean, modern aesthetic with intuitive navigation" that contain zero information. The Anti-Slop checks (banned phrases, mandatory Restraint trade-off, evidence requirement) exist because every weak principle deleted is worth ten extra well-evidenced ones added.

When in doubt about whether a taste principle is good: ask "could I have written this without ever seeing this specific website?" If yes, it's slop. Throw it out.
